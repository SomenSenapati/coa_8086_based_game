# 8086 Assembly Snake Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game developed in 8086 Assembly language.
The game features basic mechanics, including snake movement, food consumption, and score tracking.
Note that the snake's tail does not grow upon consuming food.
This project was developed collaboratively by our group with assistance from CHATAI.

## Features

- Snake movement controlled via keyboard inputs
- Food items appear randomly on the screen
- Score increases when the snake consumes food
- Simple game-over conditions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this game, you'll need an 8086 emulator. We recommend using EMU8086, which can be downloaded from the official website: [EMU8086 Download](https://sites.google.com/site/emu8086assembler/download).

### Installation

1. Download and install EMU8086 on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.
3. Open the `snape.asm` file in EMU8086.
4. Assemble and run the program within the emulator.

## Usage

- Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
- Navigate the snake to consume food items (`*`) that appear randomly on the screen.
- Each food item consumed increases your score.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or itself.

## Technologies Used

- 8086 Assembly Language
- EMU8086 Emulator
